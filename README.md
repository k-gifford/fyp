# Final Year Project: Traffic Flow Optimization in an Urban Environment

Making use of Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) to simulate traffic flow scenarios in an Irish city. 

Implementing the control using Python. 

The aim is to improve vehicle throughput in junctions and to reduce overall waiting times for vehicles at junctions.

# Currently

Implementing the intelligent traffic light algorithm as described in this paper: http://bit.ly/2DDMs59
